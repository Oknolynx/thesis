\todo{search for workload descriptions for more specific use cases? e.g. web browsing, gaming, \ldots}

\cite{Traeger2008}: criteria for good fs benchmarks, mentions encrypted storage explicitly

\cite{Wright2003}: performance study of file encryption systems

\cite{Agrawal2008}: SSD workload and performance examination

\cite{Yadgar2021}: also SSD-specific, Table 1 has a good overview of ``trace repository'' papers, conclusion has a paragraph on the validity of using old workload traces

\cite{He2017}: also SSD-specific, description of different workloads (not sure how useful, though), developed a new simulator

\cite{Riska2006}, \cite{Riska2006a}, \cite{Leung2008}, \cite{Riska2009}, and \cite{Sehgal2010}: characterization/description of different disk drive workloads (maybe look at what Phoronix Suite/Postmark uses?)

\cite{Seo2014}: explains IO traces, defines classes of traces, and classifies real world traces

\cite{Pereira2013}: critically discusses IO traces and their replays

\cite{Ruemmler1993}: describes three (old) UNIX traces

\cite{Korchagin2020}: performance optimization of the Linux kernel subsystem that LUKS2 uses under Linux

\cite{Barker2019}: implements a ``fully deniable steganographic file system'' using the Linux kernel's Device Mapper (explained in \autoref{chap:otherapproaches.linux})
